## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# DSTool

To analyze different versions of the same Product Concept, I need not only a ScrapedProduct but also a ProductConcept.

A ProductConcept represents a globally recognized product idea, and multiple ScrapedProducts can be associated with it, each coming from a different source (e.g., AliExpress, Alibaba, MercadoLibre). Matching between scraped products and product concepts is automated using Google Lens, ensuring consistency and avoiding duplicate concepts.

Each ProductConcept is associated with historical statistics that are periodically updated based on new scraped data. Rather than accumulating all-time values, these stats are stored in fixed-time intervals (e.g., weekly) to allow trend analysis and better decision-making.

| **How to handle duplicate ProductConcepts?** | Should we allow merging? | Not yet implemented | Add `merged_into_id` and `status` field in `ProductConcept`. |
| **How to track price & sales changes over time?** | Do we need historical price/sales tracking? | Not yet implemented | Create `ScrapedProductHistory` table. |
| **How to manage manual review of ProductConcepts?** | Should there be a queue system for review? | `manual_review_flag` exists but no tracking | Add `ProductConceptReviewQueue` table. |
| **How to track products appearing on multiple sources?** | Can a ScrapedProduct exist in multiple sources? | `source_id` is a single foreign key | Convert to many-to-many with `ScrapedProductSource`. |
| **Should we track overall sentiment from reviews?** | Do we need an AI-generated sentiment score? | Not yet implemented | Add `average_sentiment_score` to `ScrapedProduct`. |
| **Who scraped the product?** | Do we need to store the scraper identity? | Not yet implemented | Add `scraped_by` field to `ScrapedProduct`. |
| **How should we store images?** | Should images be separate records instead of JSON? | `photo_path` is a JSON field | Create `ScrapedProductImage` table. |

| **Feature** | **Description** | **Covered?** | **Notes** |
|------------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Scraping & Comparing** | Scrapes data from Aliexpress, Alibaba, and Mercadolibre. Uses Google Lens and filtering strategies to compare. | ✅ | We have `scraped_products`, `sources`, `providers`, and `product_concepts`. Matching score added. |
| **Storage & Discarding** | Stores or discards scraped products based on criteria. | ✅ | `review_conclusion` field allows filtering. A flag for "discarded" might be useful. |
| **Best Selection for Budget** | Picks the best products for import based on budget constraints. | ⚠️ | No explicit budget-related table/columns. Should we add `cost_analysis` fields? |
| **Quotation & Reporting** | Generates reports for product selections. | ⚠️ | No explicit reporting system in DB yet. Could be managed in app logic. |
| **Automated Ordering** | Orders selected products from Aliexpress/Alibaba. | ❌ | No direct handling of ordering process. Could be an external integration. |
| **Massive Upload to Mercadolibre** | Creates MercadoLibre listings with images, descriptions, and prices. | ✅ | `ScrapedProduct` structure supports it. Consider a `MercadoLibreListing` table for structured uploads. |
| **Tracking Performance of Selected Products** | Monitors performance to refine future selections. | ✅ | `stats` table tracks sales and trends. Historical stats are planned. |
Possible Additions
Budget constraints: Should we add a budget table or max_budget field to ProductConcept?
Reporting system: Should reports be stored in a separate reports table?
Order tracking: Do you want to track orders in the DB or rely on external integrations?
Mercadolibre automation: If we manage massive uploads, should we track listing statuses (published, pending, failed)?
